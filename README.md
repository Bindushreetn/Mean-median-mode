# Mean-median-mode
In practically every field where we work with numbers, mean, median, and mode are the cornerstones of statistics. For numerical calculations, Python is among the best programming languages. Therefore, you should be able to compute mean, median, and mode in Python without needing any built-in libraries or modules.


Mean:
The average value of all the variables in a dataset is known as the mean. In order to get the mean value of a dataset, we must first calculate the sum of all values and then divide that sum by the total number of values.


Median:
The middle value in a list of values is called the median. The midpoint of all the values in a dataset needs to be calculated in this case. However, we must first sort all of the data before computing the Median.The median value can be calculated in two different ways.
If there are even numbers of values:Median  = [(n/2)th term + {(n/2)+1}th]/2
If there are more odd than even values:Median = {(n+1)/2}term


Mode:
The value with the highest frequency of occurrence is called the mode.


Summary:
So, without utilising a library or a built-in Python function, this is how you can compute mean, mid-value, and mode using Python. One of the best programming languages for performing mathematical calculations is Python. In order to compute mean, median, and mode in Python without utilising any built-in Python libraries or modules, you should be aware of how to do so.
